# Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?

**Tech is expensive to purchase. Not everyone has access to tech**

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

**Great way to rent out tech for low cost. Especially if you are not going to need the tech again**

- What is the mission statement?

**Our mission is to ensure that users have a safe platform to buy/rent tech products by ensuring security and a variety of products to choose from.**

# Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

**Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have for rent such as cameras, TVs, Party equipment like speakers/fog machines etc. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete rental data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item. No payment processing necessary for MVP.**

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

**Payment options**

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
**Grover has over 300 tech products listed. Luminoid has only four categories of products but one specifying drones. Best Buy also allows you to test tech before purchasing it**

---

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

**react-day-picker, react-rater, styled components, formik, yup**

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

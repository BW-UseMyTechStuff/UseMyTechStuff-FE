# Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?

**Tech is expensive to purchase. Not everyone has access to tech**

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

**Great way to rent out tech for low cost. Especially if you are not going to need the tech again**

- What is the mission statement?

**Our mission is to ensure that users have a safe platform to buy/rent tech products by ensuring security and a variety of products to choose from.**

# Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

**Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have for rent such as cameras, TVs, Party equipment like speakers/fog machines etc. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete rental data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item. No payment processing necessary for MVP.**

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

**Payment options**

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
**Grover has over 300 tech products listed. Luminoid has only four categories of products but one specifying drones. Best Buy also allows you to test tech before purchasing it**

---

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

**react-day-picker, react-rater, styled components, formik, yup**

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)




                                            Team Contribution
I communicated back and forth with all members of my build week team addressing front and back end issues.
I pair-programmed for the majority of my week with the other Front-end developer and we applied our skills to make our awesome project together using VScode Liveshare. I think we both put in a lot of work and we are proud of the outcome  https://usemytechstuffv2.netlify.com/
                                                HTML/CSS
I researched and used our basic knowledge of HTML and CSS to design the layout of our beautiful app, following the same color scheme.
Responsiveness
The site is responsive down through the mobile size (below 500px).
Mobile styling seemed intimidating at first, but it ended up being a breeze.
                                        JavaScript Fundamentals
We installed tons of dependencies to incorporate all kinds of different features of Javascript. From Objects to Functions, Styled Components to Axios requests, and Routes to Forms, we included the full package!
                                            Applied JavaScript
After building the registration and login components, we worked on the functionality for listing an item as well as edit and delete buttons. Adding drop down menus was fun as well as neatly formatting all of our pages.
I built the login component and helped with the registration form as well. I learned a lot this build week and I can definitely say with confidence that I am ready to take everything I learned to the next level in the future.                                                           Contribution                
 I spent loads of time figuring out errors and running through meetings with front end devs and our back end dev. Creating functions was something else I worked on as well as getting the functionality of our drop down menus to work. It ended up being a great challenge that I handled and comprehended very well.
I think the teams communication skills were perfect. We all got along and really enjoyed creating this app. Private routing was a challenge for us for sure, but we pushed through it and our proud of the outcome. I also fixed some functionality during the process of listing an item as well as working on the edit and delete buttons once an item is for sale. Overall it definitely was intimidating at times, but I think we created an awesome, useful, responsive app as well as a wonderful piece for our porfolios.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
